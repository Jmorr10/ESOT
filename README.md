# ESOT
This program uses a genetic algorithm to determine the most efficient network order of an energy grid for a given perturbation. Based on a problem given by an engineering professor at my university.

# Note
This code has not been edited or maintained since it was written. The code is sloppy and serves to remind me of what NOT to do when programming.
